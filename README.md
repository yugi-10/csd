# Way2School-SchoolBus_tracking_app
Abstract: Way2School, a comprehensive web application designed to enhance the safety and
security of school bus transportation. With an increasing concern for the safety of
children during their commute to and from school, Way2School offers a solution that
allows parents to track their childrenâ€™s school buses in real-time. The application
features child profiles for easy management and notification/alert mechanisms to
inform parents of important events, such as when the bus approaches their house or
when the bus speed exceeds the set limit. Developed with modern web technologies,
Way2School ensures user data security and privacy while providing an intuitive user
experience.
